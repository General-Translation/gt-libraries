## Overview

This is a reference doc on the General Translation CLI tool.

The CLI tool is used for managing your project's translations.
It allows you to [generate translations](/docs/cli/translate), [generate translation templates](/docs/cli/generate), and [setup your project for translation](/docs/cli/setup).
Read more about `gtx-cli` [here](/docs/cli).

## What does the CLI tool do?

If you are using `gt-next`, you will primarily be concerned with the [`translate`](/docs/cli/translate) and [`setup`](/docs/cli/setup) commands.
The CLI tool is used for managing your project and your translations.

 * [The `translate` command](/docs/cli/translate) is meant to be added to the CD pipeline.
   It is used to scan your project for content to be translated.
   The content is then uploaded to a CDN or added to your app bundle to be used at runtime.
 * [The `setup` command ](/docs/cli/setup) is used to automatically integrate the General Translation library into your project.
   It will scan through your project and wrap any JSX content with a `<T>` component.
