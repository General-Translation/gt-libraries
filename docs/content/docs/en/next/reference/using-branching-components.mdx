## Overview

Branching Components in `gt-next` enable dynamic content rendering based on specific conditions. These components include:

- [`<Branch>`](/docs/next/api/components/branch): Renders content based on a matching `branch` prop.
- [`<Plural>`](/docs/next/api/components/plural): Renders content based on pluralization rules for a given number.

Both components provide powerful tools for managing conditional logic and dynamic content in localized applications.

In this reference, we will cover:
- What Branching Components are and how they work.
- Design patterns for using Branching Components effectively.
- Some examples of how to use each Branching Component.
- Common pitfalls to avoid when working with Branching Components.

## What Are Branching Components?

Branching Components dynamically choose which content to render based on a specific condition or value.

### `<Branch>` Component
The `<Branch>` component allows you to render different content based on a provided `branch` value.
If no matching branch is found, the fallback `children` content is rendered.

For example, the `<Branch>` component is perfect for conditional rendering based on application state, user preferences, or any dynamic data.

### `<Plural>` Component
The `<Plural>` component extends the functionality of `<Branch>` by handling pluralization and number agreement automatically.
It uses the provided `n` value to determine which plural form to display, based on locale-specific rules.

For example, the `<Plural>` component is ideal for rendering singular and plural text dynamically, such as "1 item" vs. "2 items."

## Design Patterns

### Branching Logic with `<Branch>` [#branch-logic]

The `<Branch>` component is used for flexible content switching based on a `branch` value.
You can define multiple possible branches, and the component will render the content corresponding to the matching branch key.

```javascript copy
import { T, Branch } from 'gt-next';

export default function UserStatus({ status }) {
  return (
    <T id="UserStatus">
      <Branch
        branch={status}
        active={<p>The user is active.</p>}
        inactive={<p>The user is inactive.</p>}
      >
        <p>Status unknown.</p>
      </Branch>
    </T>
  );
}
```
### Pluralization with `<Plural>` [#plural-logic]

The `<Plural>` component automates pluralization logic based on the value of `n`.
The component dynamically chooses the appropriate plural form for the given number and locale.

```javascript copy
import { T, Plural } from 'gt-next';

export default function ItemCount({ count }) {
  return (
    <T id="item_count">
      <Plural
        n={count}
        one={<>You have <Num>1</Num> item.</>}
        other={<>You have <Num>{count}</Num> items.</>}
      />
    </T>
  );
}
```

The available plural forms depend on the locale and follow [Unicode CLDR pluralization rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules).

## Examples

### `<Branch>` Example

The `<Branch>` component dynamically renders content based on the provided branch prop.
In this example, it displays different descriptions based on the user's subscription plan.
```javascript copy
import { Branch } from 'gt-next';

export default function SubscriptionDetails({ plan }) {
  return (
    <Branch
      branch={plan}
      free={<p>You are on the Free plan. Upgrade to unlock more features!</p>}
      premium={<p>You are enjoying the Premium plan with full access to features.</p>}
      enterprise={<p>You are on the Enterprise plan. Contact support for tailored solutions.</p>}
    >
      <p>No subscription plan detected.</p>
    </Branch>
  );
}
```

 * The branch prop determines which plan message to display.
 * If plan is `"free"`, `"premium"`, or `"enterprise"`, the corresponding message is shown.
 * If plan doesn't match any of these values, the fallback content (`"No subscription plan detected."`) is displayed.


### `<Plural>` Example

The `<Plural>` component dynamically handles singular and plural content based on the value of `n`.
This example displays the number of unread messages in a user's inbox.

```javascript copy
import { T, Plural, Num } from 'gt-next';

export default function UnreadMessages({ unreadCount }) {
  return (
    <T id="unread_messages">
      <Plural
        n={unreadCount}
        one={<>You have <Num>{unreadCount}</Num> unread message.</>}
        other={<>You have <Num>{unreadCount}</Num> unread messages.</>}
      />
    </T>
  );
}
```
 * The `n` prop specifies the number of unread messages.
 * If `unreadCount` is `1`, it renders: `"You have 1 unread message."`
 * For any other value, it renders: `"You have X unread messages."` where `X` is the value of `unreadCount` formatted by `<Num>`.

## Common Pitfalls

### Missing Branch Values [#missing-branch]

If a branch value is not provided or does not match any keys, the `<Branch>` component will render the fallback children content.
Always ensure that the possible branch keys match the values passed to the branch prop.

```javascript copy
import { Branch } from 'gt-next';

export default function StatusMessage({ status }) {
  return (
    <Branch
      branch={status}
      active={<p>The user is active.</p>}
      inactive={<p>The user is inactive.</p>}
    >
      <p>Status unknown.</p>
    </Branch>
  );
}
```
If `status` is `undefined` or a value other than `active` or `inactive`, the fallback content `“Status unknown.”` will be displayed.


### Missing Plural Forms [#plural-locale]

Remember to specify all necessary plural forms in your fallback language.
This is how `gt-next` ensures that your application always has fallback content to display.

## Notes
 * Branching Components are essential for managing dynamic and localized content in applications.
 * The `<Branch>` component is highly flexible and can adapt to various conditions and states.
 * The `<Plural>` component simplifies pluralization by adhering to locale-specific rules automatically.
 * Always include a fallback `children` prop for better error handling and user experience.

## Next Steps
 * Check out [`<Branch>`](/docs/next/api/components/branch) and [`<Plural>`](/docs/next/api/components/plural) in the API Reference for more details.
