## Overview


This document provides guidance on how to manage locales in your Next.js application with the `gt-next`.
We will walk through configuring the list of locales you want to support, then triggering the generation of translations.

This library uses the [BCP-47 standard](/docs/reference/locale-strings) to define locales.
See a list of currently supported locales [here](/docs/reference/supported-locales).

## Configuring Locales

There are two ways to change your locales for production:
 1. The CLI tool
 2. The `gt.config.json` file (preferred)

In order for translation to be performed, you must add the translate command to your build script:

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && next build"
  }
}
```

This will generate the necessary translations and store them in the cloud or in your local filesystem depending on your configuration.


### Managing locales with the CLI tool

The simplest way to manage locales is specifying them through the [`npx gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command by using the `--locales` flag.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate --locales en-US zh jp && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```

This will generate translations for Chinese (`zh`) and Japanese (`jp`).

### Using `gt.config.json` (preferred)

A more robust way of managing locales is by using the `gt.config.json` file.
you can specify the list of locales you want to support with the `locales` property.

```json title="gt.config.json" copy
{
  "locales": ["zh", "jp"],
}
```

## Whitelisted locales

As an optional feature, you can add a list of whitelisted locales.
This is accessible through the dashboard under the Project Locales page.
If you enable this feature, any attempts to call npx translate with non-whitelisted locales will fail.

## Notes
 * You can manage locales through the dashboard, the `gt.config.json` file, or the CLI tool.
 * Using `gt.config.json` or CLI tool to manage locales will disable the **Manage Locales** feature in the dashboard.


 ## Next Steps
 * Learn about the locale syntax in the [Locale Strings](/docs/reference/locale-strings) reference.
