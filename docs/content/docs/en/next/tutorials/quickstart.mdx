## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that uses the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router).

For a project using the Pages Router, follow the [React docs](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart).

We will cover 3 simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Running the setup wizard
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Adding environment variables
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Cleaning up strings
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup

### 1. Running the setup wizard

The setup wizard will walk you through the process of internationalizing your project.

```bash
npx gtx-cli@latest init
```

To manually setup your project, follow the [manual setup guide](#manual-setup).

The setup wizard will:

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Configure your project's supported locales.
3. Wrap your project's JSX components with the `<T>` component.
4. Add `withGTConfig()` to your `next.config.js` file.
5. Generate a production API key and project ID for your project.

See the [setup wizard docs](/docs/cli/init) for more information.

### 2. Adding environment variables

The setup wizard will create a `.env.local` file for you in the root of your project containing your production API key and project ID.

However, in order to use `gt-next` in development mode, you will need to add a development API key instead of a production one.


<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard).
    Go to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click **Create Dev API Key**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Add the Project ID and Development API key to your environment.
    ```bash title=".env.local" copy
    GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
    GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
  **Protect Your API Keys!**

  Development keys should **only** ever be used in development.
  Likewise, production keys should **only** ever be used in production.
  *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*
</Callout>

### 3. Cleaning up strings

The setup wizard will wrap all of your project's JSX components with the `<T>` component.
However, you may notice that strings are unaffected.

For example, if you have a string constant like this:

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
export default function Example() {
  const greeting = "Hello, world!";
  return <p>{greeting}</p>;
}
```

The setup wizard will not touch this string.

To fix this, you can use the [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/useGT) hook and [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/getGT) function to translate the string.

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { useGT } from "gt-next/client";
export default function Example() {
  const t = useGT();
  return <p>{t("Hello, world!")}</p>;
}
```

## Let's Try It Out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language [#see-your-app-in-a-different-language]

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add the [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/next/api/components/localeSelector) component to your app.
    This will allow you to select a different language for your app.
    <Callout>
      **Tip:**
      You can also change your language in your browser settings.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your Next.js app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
      ```bash
      bun run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    If you are deciding to test different languages by changing your browser's language, this issue may occur.

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
    * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do languages take a long time to load in dev?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    
    This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
    All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
    Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some things translating and others not?">
    **JSX Translation**

    Right now, the wizard automatically adds `<T>` components around text content.
    We are currently working on a solution that automatically setup string translations.
    Until then, if you are rendering a string, please follow [this guide](/docs/next/reference/translating-strings) for translating strings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some translations inaccurate?">
    The most likely cause of an inaccurate translation is ambiguous wording.
    For example, "apple" can be a fruit or a technology company.

    To fix this, you can provide more context to the translation with the `context` prop.
    The [`<T>`](/docs/next/api/components/t), [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/useGT), and [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/getGT) functions all support a `context` prop.
    For example:
    ```jsx
    <T context="the technology company">Apple</T>
    ```    
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Manual Setup [#manual-setup]

If you prefer to do the setup manually, follow the steps below.

### 1. Install libraries

Install the [gt-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next) and [gtx-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtx-cli) libraries.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-next
  npm i gtx-cli --save-dev
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-next
  yarn add gtx-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-next
  bun add gtx-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-next
  pnpm add gtx-cli --save-dev
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### 2. Add the `withGTConfig()` plugin

Add [`withGTConfig()`](/docs/next/api/config/withGTConfig) to your `next.config.js` file.
You can specify the languages you want to support by passing an array of [locale codes](/docs/reference/supported-locales).

```js title="next.config.js" copy
import { withGTConfig } from 'gt-next/config';

const nextConfig = {};

export default withGTConfig(nextConfig, {
  locales: ['pt', 'es'], // Support for Portuguese and Spanish
});
```


### 3. Add the `<T>` component

Wrap any nested JSX content in the [`<T>` component](/docs/next/api/components/t) to make it translatable.
For more information, check out the [guide on using `<T>` components](/docs/next/reference/t-reference).

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { T } from "gt-next";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>
        This gets translated.
      </p>
    </T>  // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

Use the [`<Var>` component](/docs/next/api/components/var) to designate JSX content that should not be translated.

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { T, Var } from "gt-next";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>
        This gets translated. <Var>This does not.</Var>
      </p>
    </T>  // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

For strings, you can use [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/useGT) or [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/strings/getGT) for translation.

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { useGT } from "gt-next/client";
import { getGT } from "gt-next/server";

export default function Example() {
  const t = useGT(); // client side // [!code highlight]
  const t = await getGT(); // server side // [!code highlight]
  return (
    <p>
      {/* [!code highlight] */}
      {t("This gets translated.")}
    </p>
  );
}
```
