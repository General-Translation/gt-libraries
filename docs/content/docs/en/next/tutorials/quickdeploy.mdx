## Overview

This is a short tutorial to help you deploy your Next.js app with GT.

We will do this in 3 steps:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add your production API keys.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Run the init command to configure your project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the translate command to your build script.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have followed the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/next/tutorials/quickstart) to set up your Next.js app with GT.

## Step 1: Add your production API keys üîë

Add your **production** API key and Project ID to your production environment variables.

From your [dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/signin), go to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
Click on **Create API Key**, and add them to your production envrionment.

```bash copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Production keys should **only** ever be used in production.
    Likewise, development keys should **only** ever be used in development.
    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*
</Callout>

## Step 2: Run the init command üîß

Run the init command to configure your project.

```bash copy
npx gtx-cli init
```

<Callout>
  If you do not want your translations to be hosted on the GT CDN, select "Local" when asked where your
  language files are stored. You will also need to configure the [`loadTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-translations) function.
</Callout>


## Step 3: Add the translate command to your build script üèóÔ∏è

The next step is to add the [translate command](/docs/cli/translate) to your build script,
and specify the [locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) that you would like to ship to production.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```

That's it! You are now ready to deploy your Next.js with GT!
