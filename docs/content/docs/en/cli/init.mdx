## Usage

Use this command to initialize your project's GT settings. This command is optional, and only serves to create a `gt.config.json` file in the root of your project.

```bash
npx gtx-cli init
```

## Overview

The `init` command helps you configure your project's GT settings.

It will create a `gt.config.json` file in the root of your project.

The file will contain the following settings:

- `defaultLocale`: The default locale for your project.
- `locales`: An array of [supported locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) for your project.
- `files`: This is an object that contains information about the content you want to translate.

For more specific information about the `gt.config.json` file, please see the [config docs](/docs/cli/reference/config).
