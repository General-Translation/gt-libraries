## Introduction

The React SDK allows you to internationalize your React application in a easy and maintainable way.

There are 4 main concepts to understand about the SDK.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    The `<GTProvider>` component
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The `<T>` component
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The `useGT` hook
  </Step>
  <Step>
    (Optional) The `useDict` hook
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The `<GTProvider>` component

```tsx
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';
```

The `<GTProvider>` component is the main component that you need to add to your application.

It is used to provide the rest of your application with context. 

This context includes the current language and the relevant translations for that language.

### Important Considerations

- The provider should wrap your entire application.
- Ideally, it should be placed as high in the tree as possible, such as in your root component.

See the [GTProvider](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) page for more information.

## The `<T>` component

The `<T>` component is the recommended way to translate content in your application.

It is a React component that can be used to wrap any JSX element, and will automatically render the content of the element into a supported language.

<Callout type="info">
We recommend using the `<T>` component wherever possible, since it allows for the most flexibility in translations.

Unlike strings, the `<T>` component can be used to translate HTML content, making it much more powerful than string translations.
</Callout>

### Examples

```tsx
<T>
  <div>Hello, world!</div>
</T>
```

```tsx
<T>
  <div>
    <h1> Here is an image </h1>
    <img src="https://example.com/image.png" alt="Example" />
  </div>
</T>
```

```tsx
<T>
  Formatting can be done easily with the `<T>` component.
  <Num>{1000}</Num>
  <DateTime>{new Date()}</DateTime>
  <Currency>{1000}</Currency>
</T>
```

See the [components](/docs/react/guides/jsx) guide to learn about the different ways to use the `<T>` component.

See the [T API Reference](/docs/react/api/components/t) for the API of the `<T>` component.

## The `useGT` hook

The `useGT` hook is a React hook that can be used similarly to the `<T>` component, with some trade-offs.

The hook returns a function that can be used to translate strings.

```tsx
const translate = useGT();

translate('Hello, world!');
```

Compared to the `<T>` component, the `useGT` hook allows for more flexibility in your codebase.

For example, if you have a complex data structure with nested strings, a `<T>` component would be more difficult to use.

```tsx
const t = useGT();
const data = {
  title: t('Hello, world!'),
  description: t('This is a description'),
};
```

See the [strings](/docs/react/guides/strings) guide to learn more about the `useGT` hook.

See the [useGT API Reference](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) for more information.

## The `useDict` hook

The `useDict` hook is a React hook that returns a function that can be used to retrieve translations for a given key.

```tsx title="dictionary.ts"
const dictionary = {
  hello: {
    world: 'Hello, world!',
  },
};
```

```tsx title="App.tsx"
const translate = useDict();
translate('hello.world');
```

This behavior is similar to other translation libraries, such as `react-i18next` and `next-intl`.

<Callout type="warn">
We do not recommend using the `useDict` hook in your application. Frequent use of the `useDict` hook will make your codebase more difficult to maintain, 
and will lead to large tech debt.

Instead, we recommend using the `<T>` component or the `useGT` hook.

If you are migrating from another i18n library, the `useDict` hook is a drop-in replacement and can useful for incrementally migrating your codebase.
</Callout>

See the [dictionaries](/docs/react/guides/dictionaries) guide to learn more about the `useDict` hook.

See the [useDict API Reference](/docs/react/api/dictionary/useDict) for more information.
