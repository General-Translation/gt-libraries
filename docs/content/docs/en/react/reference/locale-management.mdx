title: Manage Locales
description: How to manage your app's locales
---


## Overview

This document provides guidance on how to manage locales in your React application with the `gt-react`.
We will walk through configuring the list of locales you want to support, then triggering the generation of translations.
We will also cover how to pass the config file to your app.

This library uses the [BCP-47 standard](/docs/reference/locale-strings) to define locales.
See a list of currently supported locales [here](/docs/reference/supported-locales).

## Configuring locales

There are two ways to change your locales for production:
 1. The CLI tool
 2. The `gt.config.json` file (preferred)


### Managing locales with the CLI tool

The simplest way to manage locales is specifying them through the [`npx gtx-cli translate`](/docs/cli/translate) command by using the `--locales` flag.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate --locales zh jp && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```

This will generate translations for Chinese (`zh`) and Japanese (`jp`).


Make sure that your app knows that these locales are supported by passing the config file to the GTProvider component.
```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';
import config from './gt.config.json';

function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider locales={["zh", "jp"]}>
      <YourApp />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```


### Using `gt.config.json` (preferred)

A more robust way of managing locales is by using the `gt.config.json` file.
you can specify the list of locales you want to support with the `locales` property.

```json title="gt.config.json" copy
{
  "locales": ["zh", "jp"],
}
```

Then just pass the config file to your GTProvider component.

```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';
import config from './gt.config.json';

function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider {...config}>
      <YourApp />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```

The final step is to add the translate command to your build script.
You do not need to specify locales with the `--locales` flag because they are already defined in the `gt.config.json` file.
```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```

## Whitelisted locales

As an optional feature, you can add a list of whitelisted locales.
This is accessible through the dashboard under the Project Locales page.
If you enable this feature, any attempts to call npx translate with non-whitelisted locales will fail.

## Notes
 * You can manage locales through the dashboard, the `gt.config.json` file, or the CLI tool.
 * Remember to pass the locales to [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/componenets/gtprovider) in your app.

 ## Next Steps
 * Learn about the locale syntax in the [Locale Strings](/docs/reference/locale-strings) reference.
