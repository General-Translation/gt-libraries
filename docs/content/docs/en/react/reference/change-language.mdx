description: How to change the language of your React app

## Overview

In this guide, we'll show you how to change the language of your React app.

If you have not yet setup your app with `gt-react`, please refer to the [setup guide](/docs/react) before continuing.

## Setup

There are three ways to change the language of your app using `gt-react`.

1. Using the [`useSetLocale()`](/docs/react/api/helpers/useSetLocale) hook
2. Using the [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/react/api/components/localeSelector) component
3. Using the [`useLocaleSelector()`](/docs/react/api/helpers/useLocaleSelector) hook

We'll cover all three methods in this guide.

## Using the `useSetLocale` hook

The `useSetLocale` hook is a client-side hook that allows you to change the language of your app. It must be used within a `GTProvider` component.

```tsx
import { useSetLocale } from 'gt-react';
export default function MyComponent() {
  const setLocale = useSetLocale();

  return <button onClick={() => setLocale('en')}>Set Locale</button>;
}
```

Simply provide the locale you want to change to as the argument to the callback function returned by the `useSetLocale` hook.

## Using the `<LocaleSelector>` component

The `<LocaleSelector>` component is a client-side component that allows you to change the language of your app. It must be used within a `GTProvider` component.

This is a bare-bones UI dropdown that displays all the locales you have enabled in your project, and allows users to select a different locale.

```tsx
import { LocaleSelector } from 'gt-react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <LocaleSelector />;
}
```

## Using the `useLocaleSelector` hook

Alternatively, if you would like to create your own locale selector component, you can use the `useLocaleSelector` hook.

This hook returns the current locale, the list of locales, and the `useSetLocale` hook.

```tsx
import { useLocaleSelector } from 'gt-react';
```

See the [API reference](/docs/react/api/helpers/useLocaleSelector) for more information.
