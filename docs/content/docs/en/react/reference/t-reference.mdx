## What is the `<T>` Component?

The `<T>` component is the primary way to translate text and content in the `gt-react` library.
It allows for inline translation of text and JSX structures, providing a more direct way to manage translations in your application.
This is often times more convenient for the developer as it allows for more direct control over the translation content.

The `<T>` component supports static text, JSX structures, and context-aware translations.
When no translation is available, it gracefully falls back to displaying the content in the application's default locale.

```jsx
<T>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</T>
```

---

## Design Patterns

In this section, we will detail common design patterns used with the `<T>` component.
This will also touch on topics that are tangentially related to the `<T>` component, but equally important, such as
string translation, translating content in advanced, and privacy concerns.

### Wrapping your `<T>` components in a `<GTProvider>` [#gtprovider]

`<T>` is used to translate static text and JSX structures.
`<T>` **MUST** be wrapped in a [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) at a higher level.
Our advice is to wrap your application in a `<GTProvider>` at the root level to provide this context.

```javascript copy
import { GTProvider } from "gt-react"; 
import MyApp from "./MyApp";
 
export default function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider>
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider> 
  );
}
```

### Variables in `<T>` Components

Variables components can be used in `<T>` components to (1) display dynamic values and/or (2) mark content that should not be translated.
Think of things like a user's name: it's (1) different from person to person and (2) should not change even when the language changes.

```jsx title="DynamicGreeting.js" copy
import { T, Var } from 'gt-react';

export default function DynamicGreeting({ user }) {
  return (
    <T>
      Hello, <Var>{user.name}</Var>! // [!code highlight]
    </T>
  );
}
```

There are many variable components: [`<Var>`](/docs/react/api/components/var), [`<Num>`](/docs/react/api/components/num), [`<Currency>`](/docs/react/api/components/currency) and [`<DateTime>`](/docs/react/api/components/datetime).
Some of these will automatically reformat the content based on the user's locale. Others will simply mark the content as "do not translate".
Also, these components don't necessarily need to be wrapped in a `<T>` component to reformat content.

Read more about it in [this article about variable components](/docs/react/reference/using-variable-components).

### Branching in `<T>` Components

Branching components can be used to display different content based on conditions for translations.
These include [`<Plural>`](/docs/react/api/components/plural) and [`<Branch>`](/docs/react/api/components/branch) components.
We use these components because they allow for a more optimized translation process.

For example, the `<Plural>` component allows you to mark a sentences that should be pluralized when translation occurs.

```jsx title="Count.js" copy
import { T, Plural } from 'gt-react';

export default function Count({ num }) {
  return (
    <T>
      <Plural
        n={num} // <-- variable to check // [!code highlight]
        singular={<p>There is one item.</p>}  // [!code highlight]
        plural={<p>There are multiple items.</p>}  // [!code highlight]
      />
    </T>
  );
}
```

It is also useful as it standardizes your pluralization logic across your application in your base language.

You can specify different options depending on which component you use.
Read more about it in the [Branching Components](/docs/react/reference/using-branching-components) article.

### Translating Strings [#translating-strings]

If you want to translate just a string, you can use [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/components/strings/useGT).
It is used for translating strings at buildtime.

```jsx title="Greeting.js" copy
function Greeting() {
  const t = useGT();
  return <p>{t('Hello, my friend!')}</p>; // [!code highlight]
}
```
For more information, you can refer to [our guide on translating strings](/docs/react/reference/translating-strings).


That's it! You have successfully translated your application into French, Spanish, and Japanese.

For a more detailed guide on deploying your application, please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/react/tutorials/quickdeploy) guide.
For more information on the command, please refer to the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide.

### Adding ids to `<T>` Components

A handy debugging trick is to add an `id` prop to your `<T>` components.
This allows you to track which translations are being used in your application.
It also allows you to use the [Translation Editor](/signin) to make changes to your translations without redeploying.

```jsx title="Greeting.js" copy
import { T } from 'gt-react';

export default function Greeting() {
  return (
    <T id="greeting">
      Hello, world!
    </T>
  );
}
```

## Production considerations [#production]

### Deploying to production

Make sure to run the translate command before deploying to production, so that all translations are available at runtime.
We recommend adding it to your in your CD pipeline or as a part of your build script.
```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate --languages fr es ja && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>",
  }
}
```

That's it! You have successfully translated your application into French, Spanish, and Japanese.

For a more detailed guide on deploying your application, please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/react/tutorials/quickdeploy) guide.
For more information on the command, please refer to the [CLI Tool](/docs/cli/translate) reference guide.

### Behavior: Development vs Production

In development, the `<T>` component will translate content on-demand.
This means that when the component is rendered, it will perform a translation immediately.
We do this for convenience to make development with other languages easier.

To enable this behavior, just add a Dev API key to your environment.

In production, the `<T>` component will translate content at build time.
This means that you have to run the translation command before deploying your application.

<Callout>
  **Tip:**
  If you want to simulate production behavior in development, just use a production API key in your development build.
</Callout>

### Privacy Concerns

With some exceptions, all content wrapped in a `<T>` component is sent to the General Translation APIs for translation.
This might not be desirable for rendering sensitive data, such as usernames, account numbers, etc.

To circumvent this issue, use [Variable Components](/docs/react/reference/using-variable-components#privacy) to handle private information.
This ensures that no sensitive data is sent to the General Translation APIs for translation.
The localization of all content wrapped in any Variable Component is handled locally.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

The simplest use case for `<T>` is to translate static text.

```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-react';

export default function BasicUsage() {
  return (
    <T>
      Hello, world!
    </T>
  );
}
```

This example ensures that `"Hello, world!"` is translated based on the user's locale.
For example, in a Spanish locale, it may render as `"Â¡Hola, mundo!"`.


### Context

The `<T>` component supports additional context to refine translations.
Adding a context prop allows the same id to resolve to different translations depending on the context provided.
```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-react';

export default function FormalGreeting() {
  return (
    <T context="formal">
      Hi there!
    </T>
  );
}
```

For example, the context `"formal"` could yield a translation such as `"Good day, everyone!"`, while the same `id` without context might yield `"Hi there!"` in the other language.
Of course, no change would occur for the base language.

### Nested Components

The `<T>` component can also translate JSX structures.
Any children of the `<T>` will be translated.

```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-react';
import CustomButton from './CustomButton';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T>
      This will be translated
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <CustomButton>This text will also be translated!</CustomButton>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T>
  );
}
```

## Common Pitfalls


### Direct descendants only [#direct-text]

The `<T>` component only translates text passed directly as a child.
This means that if you have content inside a component that is not directly passed to `<T>`, it will not be translated.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```javascript copy
function UntranslatedContent() {
  return (
    <p>This content is not translated</p>
  );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
  return (
    <T>
      <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
      <UntranslatedContent />
    </T>
  );
}
```

In this example, the content inside `<UntranslatedContent>` will not be translated.
Only the content directly inside `<T>` will be translated, like the `<h1>` tag and its children.

This occurs because of how React renders components.
It is a bit complicated, but the gist is that React does not know the content of a component until it has rendered.
Therefore, the contents of components like `<UntranslatedContent>` are not translated.
However, any text directly between the two `<T>` tags will be translated.
<Callout>
    **Note:** A good rule of thumb is that any content that is *literally* between the two `<T>` in the file will be translated.
    You can always add another `<T>` to translate the content that is not being translated, though nesting `<T>` components is not recommended.
</Callout>

#### What's the fix?

Your first instinct might be to add an additional `<T>` component inside `<UntranslatedContent>`, but this is not recommended.
We discuss this more [below](#nested-t).

The solution is to always wrap the text in the `<T>` component directly, like so:

```javascript copy
function TranslatedContent() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>This content <b>IS</b> translated</p>
    </T>
  );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
  return (
    <>
      <T>
        <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
      </T>
      <TranslatedContent />
    </>
  );
}
```


#### What about variables? [#variables]

Variables are a little more complicated because they have the tendency to change their values.
We recommend using [Variable Components](/docs/react/reference/using-variable-components) for displaying dynamic values and [Branching Components](/docs/react/reference/using-branching-components) for conditional logic.

### Nested `<T>` Components [#nested-t]

Nesting `<T>` components is not allowed.
Because of react's rendering system, this can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues when translating on-demand.

Here is an example of **what not to do**:

```jsx copy
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <T>
      Hello, friend!
    </T>
  );
}

export default function NestedTranslation() {
  return (
    <T>
      <T> {/* Don't do this! */} // [!code highlight]
        Hello, world!
      </T>
      <SomeComponent /> {/* This still counts. Don't do this! */} // [!code highlight]
    </T>
  );
}
```

The solution here is to remove the outtermost `<T>` component.

### Conditional Content [#conditional-content]

Similar to [rendering variable content](#variables), conditional content within a `<T>` component needs to be handled properly.
It is always best practice to wrap the conditional content in a [Branching Component](/docs/react/reference/using-branching-components) to optimize the translation of content.

```jsx copy
import { T, Branch } from 'gt-react';

export default function Header({ user }) {
  return (
    <T>
      <h2>
        <Branch
          branch={user.hasAccount}
          true={<p>Welcome back, {user.name}!</p>}
          false={<p>Please log in to continue.</p>}
        />
      </h2>
    </T>
  );
}
```

## Notes
 * `<T>` components are used to translate arbitrary JSX Content.
 * Wrap your app with a [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) to enable translations.
 * `<T>` translates contents at buildtime, not runtime. Development will perform on-demand translation for convenience, but this is not the case in production.
