## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [React](https://react.dev) project.

We will cover 4 simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Installing the required libraries
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select languages
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the `<T>` component
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add your environment variables
  </Step>
</Steps>

This entire process should take under **5 minutes**.

## Setup

### 1. Install libraries

Install the [gt-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react) and [gtx-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtx-cli) libraries.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react
  npm i gtx-cli --save-dev
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react
  yarn add gtx-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-react
  bun add -d gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-react
  pnpm add -D gtx-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### 2. Select languages

[`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) is used to configure the behavior of `gt-react`. 
It should be placed as high up in your app as possible, ideally at the root.

Just pass a list of [locale codes](/docs/reference/supported-locales) to add them to your app.

```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from "gt-react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";

export default function App() {
  return (
    // French and Chinese support 
    // [!code highlight]
    <GTProvider locales={['fr', 'zh']}> 
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

For a full list of `<GTProvider>` props and extended documentation, see the [API reference](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).

### 3. Add the `<T>` component

Wrap any nested JSX content in the [`<T>` component](/docs/react/api/components/t) to make it translatable.
For more information, check out the [guide on using `<T>` components](/docs/react/reference/t-reference).

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { T } from "gt-react";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>
        This gets translated.
      </p>
    </T>  // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

Use the [`<Var>` component](/docs/react/api/components/var) to designate JSX content that should not be translated.

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { T, Var } from "gt-react";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight]
    <T>
      <p>
        This gets translated. <Var>This does not.</Var>
      </p>
    </T>  // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip:**
  To save time, run [the setup command](/docs/cli/setup).
  This will scan your codebase for translatable JSX and insert the [`<T>`](/docs/react/api/components/t) tags for you.

  ```bash title="shell" copy
  npx gtx-cli setup
  ```
</Callout>

For strings, you can use [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/strings/useGT) for translation.
For more information, check out [this guide](/docs/react/reference/translating-strings).

```jsx title="Example.js" copy
import { useGT } from "gt-react";

export default function Example() {
  const t = useGT(); // [!code highlight]
  return (
    <p>
      {/* [!code highlight] */}
      {t("This gets translated.")}
    </p>
  );
}
```

### 4. Add your environment variables

Add your API key and Project ID to your environment variables.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard).
            * Navigate to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create Dev API Key** then copy the API key and Project ID to your clipboard.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Add the Project ID and API Key to your environment variables.
        Depending on your React framework, the environment variables may look slightly different.
        These instructions are for **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS ONLY**.
        <Tabs items={["Vite", "Gatsby", "RedwoodJS", "create-react-app", "Other"]}>
            <Tab value="Vite">
            ```bash copy
            VITE_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            VITE_GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="Gatsby">
            ```bash copy
            GATSBY_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            GATSBY_GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="RedwoodJS">
            ```bash copy
            REDWOOD_ENV_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            REDWOOD_ENV_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="create-react-app">
            ```bash copy
            REACT_APP_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            REACT_APP_GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="Other">
            Many react frameworks each have a unique way of exporting environment variables to the client.
            In development environments, both `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` need to be exported to the client.

            We have added support for a few libraries so far,
            but please let us know if your framework is not listed by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries/issues/new).
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    React environment variables are often bundled into your application at build time and are publicly visible in the client-side code.
    For security reasons, you should:
    
    - Only use development API keys during local development
    - Only use production API keys with the CLI tool for deployment
    - **Never include any API keys as environment variables in production**

## Let's try it out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add the [`<LocaleSelector>`](/docs/react/api/components/localeSelector) component to your app.
    This will allow you to select a different language for your app.
    <Callout>
      **Tip:**
      You can also change your language in your browser settings.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your React app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
      ```bash
      bun run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
      ```bash
      pnpm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    If you are deciding to test different languages by changing your browser's language, this issue may occur.

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
    * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)

    If this does not work, make sure that the list of locales in your [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) is up to date.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    
    This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
    All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
    Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some things translating and others not?">
    **JSX Translation**

    Right now, the setup tool automatically adds `<T>` components around text content.
    We are currently working on a solution that will automatically setup string translations.
    Until then, if you are rendering a string, please follow [this guide](/docs/react/reference/translating-strings) for translating strings.
