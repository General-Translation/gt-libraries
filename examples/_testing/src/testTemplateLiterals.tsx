  <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {'<T>'} component.</p>
  <p>
    For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be
    translated in context.
  </p>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
      <button>Click me!</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</>;
