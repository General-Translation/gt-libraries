/**
 * The `<Plural>` component dynamically renders content based on the plural form of the given number (`n`).
 * It determines which content to display by matching the value of `n` to the appropriate pluralization branch,
 * based on the current locale or a default locale. If no matching plural branch is found, the component renders
 * the fallback `children` content.
 *
 * @example
 * ```jsx
 * <Plural
 *  n={n}
 *  one={<>There is <Num children={n}/> item.</>}
 *  other={<>There are <Num children={n}/> items.</>}
 * />
 * ```
 * In this example, if `n` is 1, it renders `"There is 1 item"`. If `n` is a different number, it renders
 * `"There are {n} items"`.
 *
 * @param {any} [children] - Fallback content to render if no matching plural branch is found.
 * @param {number} [n] - The number used to determine the plural form. This is required for pluralization to work.
 * @param {...branches} [branches] - A spread object containing possible plural branches, typically including `one` for singular
 * and `other` for plural forms, but it may vary depending on the locale.
 * @returns {Promise<React.JSX.Element>} The rendered content corresponding to the plural form of `n`, or the fallback content.
 * @throws {Error} If `n` is not provided or not a valid number.
