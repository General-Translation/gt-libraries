- Open source developer libraries
- Context-aware translation APIs
- A platform for translation management

With GT, you never need to worry about localization again. Install the libraries in your project, tag your content as you code, and we'll take care of the rest.

## Library Features

### ‚öõÔ∏è Translate entire React components, not just strings

- Just wrap your content in a `<T>` component!
- No need for complex refactoring or managing JSON files.

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {'<T>'} component.</p>
      <p>
        For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be
        translated in context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
          <button>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T>
  );
}
```

### üîé Feature parity with existing libraries

- GT libraries also support the same features as existing libraries like `next-intl` and `react-i18next`.
- Features such as dictionaries, plurals, currencies, and automatic routing are all supported.

### üîß Developer-friendly

- Setup is simple and can be done in minutes.
- All GT libraries are open-source and work standalone.
  - You can use your own translation provider or use our free AI-powered translation service.
- No more managing translation keys like `t('menu.header.title')`.
  - Just write everything in-line!

### üß† Free AI-powered translation service

- Translation hot reload in development
- Libraries integrate natively with our translation platform.
- Translations are generated for your app in seconds.
- HTML content is re-arranged and customized according to the language.

## Examples

See the [examples](examples) directory for some example projects that use our libraries. We currently support React and Next.js.

Simple interface for native pluralization and conditional logic:

```tsx
<Plural
  n={count}
  singular={<>There is <Num>{count}</Num> item</>}
  plural={<>There are <Num>{count}</Num> items</>}
/>
```

Support for translation at runtime:

```tsx
export default function Comment() {
  const comment = await getComment();

  return (
    <h1>Author: {comment.author}</h1>
    <Tx>
      <p>{comment.content}</p>
    </Tx>
  );
}
```

Intuitive i18n formatting syntax:

```tsx
return (
  <T>
    <h1> Your account information: </h1>
    Account balance: <Currency>{account.bal}</Currency> {/* Currency Formatting */}
    <br />
    Updated at: <DateTime>{account.updateTime}</DateTime> {/* Datetime Formatting */}
    <br />
    Transactions this month: <Num>{account.txCount}</Num> {/* Number Formatting */}
  </T>
);
```
