# General Translation Libraries

This monorepo contains the libraries for General Translation, a next-generation translation platform for Next.js and React applications.

Get started with General Translation at [generaltranslation.com](https://generaltranslation.com)!

Full documentation, including guides, examples, and API references, can be found at [General Translation Docs](https://generaltranslation.com/docs).

## Features

### ‚öõÔ∏è Translate entire React components, not just strings

- Just wrap your content in a `<T>` component!
- No need for complex refactoring or messy function calls.

```js
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T>
      <p>You can write any JSX as children of the {'<T>'} component.</p>
      <p>
        For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be
        translated in context.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <p>Even deeply nested components are translated in context.</p>
          <button>Click me!</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </T>
  );
}
```

### üß† AI-powered translations

- Translations are created in seconds.
- UI and HTML elements are translated in context by state of the art AI models.
- HTML content are re-arranged and customized according to the language.

### üîß Developer-friendly

- Setup is simple and can be done in minutes, no need for complex refactoring.
- Never have to worry about localization while coding, ever again.
- No more wasting time managing translation keys like `t('menu.header.title')`.
  - Just write everything in-line!

## Examples

See the [examples](examples) directory for some example projects that use our libraries. We currently support React and Next.js.

Simple interface for native pluralization and conditional logic:

```js
<Plural
  n={count}
  singular={<>There is {count} item</>}
  plural={<>There are {count} items</>}
/>
```

Support for translation at runtime:

```js
export default function Comment() {
  const comment = await getComment();

  return (
    <h1>Author: {comment.author}</h1>
    <Tx>
      <p>{comment.content}</p>
    </Tx>
  );
}
```

Intuitive i18n formatting syntax:

```tsx
return (
  <T>
    <h1> Your account information: </h1>
    Account balance: <Currency>{account.bal}</Currency> // Currency Formatting
    <br />
    Updated at: <DateTime>{account.updateTime}</DateTime> // Datetime Formatting
    <br />
    Transactions this month: <Num>{account.txCount}</Num> // Number Formatting
  </T>
);
```
